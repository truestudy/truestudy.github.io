                                            Tenants advised to obey regulations on apartment
Jakarta: A building architect has advised families planning to live in an apartment to study all the relevant regulations prior to moving in to help prevent unexpected security-related occurrences. “Tenants must obey certain regulations when living in an apartment, which is far different from living in a landed-house,”
Fendhi Ibuhindar said. “Tenants of an apartment should abide by regulations set by the owner of the high-rise building,” he added. “This is important, especially for a family that has a young child,” he was quoted as saying by okezone.com.
According to him, the trend of living in an apartment in Jakarta started only 10 years ago. Living in an apartment has increasingly become popular.
“Most of Jakarta’s residents are more accustomed to living in a landed house and when they live in an apartment, many are not ready for apartment-living habits and regulations. They have to abandon their mindset of living in a landed-house,” he said. 
He said that an owner of apartment should also consider aspects of design and building materials that are safe for children. “The quality of building materials should be prioritized,” he said. “Children’s safety should be the main concern with regards to the building materials that are used,” he said.

Tenants advised to obey regulations on apartment
Jakarta: A building architect has advised families planning to live in an apartment to study all the relevant regulations prior to moving in to help prevent unexpected security-related occurrences. “Tenants must obey certain regulations when living in an apartment, which is far different from living in a landed-house,”
Fendhi Ibuhindar said. “Tenants of an apartment should abide by regulations set by the owner of the high-rise building,” he added. “This is important, especially for a family that has a young child,” he was quoted as saying by okezone.com.
According to him, the trend of living in an apartment in Jakarta started only 10 years ago. Living in an apartment has increasingly become popular.
“Most of Jakarta’s residents are more accustomed to living in a landed house and when they live in an apartment, many are not ready for apartment-living habits and regulations. They have to abandon their mindset of living in a landed-house,” he said. 
He said that an owner of apartment should also consider aspects of design and building materials that are safe for children. “The quality of building materials should be prioritized,” he said. “Children’s safety should be the main concern with regards to the building materials that are used,” he said.

"Ini penting, terutama untuk keluarga yang memiliki anak kecil," katanya seperti dikutip okezone.Com. Menurutnya, tren tinggal di apartemen di Jakarta baru dimulai 10 tahun lalu. Tinggal di apartemen semakin populer. “Sebagian besar warga Jakarta lebih terbiasa tinggal di landed house dan ketika tinggal di apartemen banyak yang belum siap dengan kebiasaan dan aturan tinggal di apartemen. Mereka harus meninggalkan pola pikir tinggal di landed house,” ujarnya kata. Ia mengatakan, pemilik apartemen juga harus memperhatikan aspek perancangan dan material bangunan yang aman untuk anak. “Kualitas bahan bangunan harus diutamakan,” ucapnya. “Keselamatan anak harus menjadi perhatian utama terkait bahan bangunan yang digunakan,” ujarnya.

                            30. Tolong buatin ringkasan atau kesimpulan dari task dibawah dongTenants advised to obey regulations on apartment     Jakarta: A building architect has advised families planning to live in an apartment to study all the relevant regulations prior to moving in to help prevent unexpected security-related occurrences.     "Tenants must obey certain regulations when living in an apartment, which is far different from living in a landed-house," Fendhi Ibuhindar said.     "Tenants of an apartment should abide by regulations set by the owner of the high-rise building," he added.     "This is important, especially for a family that has a young child," he was quoted as saying by okezone.com.     According to him, the trend of living in an apartment in Jakarta started only 10 years ago.Living in an apartment has increasingly become popular.     "Most of Jakarta's residents are more accustomed to living in a landed house and when they live in an apartment, many are not ready for apartment-living habits and regulations. They have to abandon their mindset of living in a landed-house," hesaid.     He said that an owner of apartment should also consider aspects of designing and building materials that are safe for children."The quality of building materials should be prioritized," he said.     "Children's safety should be the main concern with regards to the building materials that are used," he said.(Adapted from: The Jakarta Post, May 9, 2014)​</h2><br />
