                                            Aladdin, a street urchin in the Arabian city of Agrabah, and his monkey Abu meet PrincessJasmine, who has snuck away from her sheltered life in the palace. Jasmine wishes to succeedher father as Sultan, but is instead expected to marry one of her royal suitors, including thecharming yet dimwitted Prince Anders. Jafar, the grand vizier, schemes to overthrow the Sultanand seeks a magic lamp hidden in the Cave of Wonders, but only "the diamond in the rough" canenter the cave.After sneaking into the royal palace and visiting Jasmine, Aladdin is captured by Jafar. Heoffers to make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine in exchange for retrieving the lamp, andwarns him to take nothing else. Inside the cave, Aladdin frees a magic carpet and finds the lamp,but Abu cannot resist touching some treasure and causes the cave to collapse. Aladdin gives thelamp to Jafar, who double crosses and kicks him and Abu into the cave, but Abu steals the lampback.Trapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent Genieinside, who explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin gets them outof the cave without using a wish on a technicality: he did not rub the lamp in the first place as hestated the wish. Determined to woo Jasmine, he uses his official first wish to become a prince,and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human.Aladdin makes an extravagant arrival at Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, but fails toimpress Jasmine. Posing as Aladdin's human attendant, the Genie is mutually smitten with Dalia,Jasmine's handmaiden. Aladdin and Jasmine bond when he takes her on a ride on the magiccarpet. Tricked into revealing his true identity, he lies to her, saying that he actually is a princeand dressed like a peasant to explore Agrabah.Jafar discovers Aladdin's identity and throws him into the palace moat, knowing that if hesurvives, it will prove he has the lamp. The Genie saves Aladdin, at the cost of his second wish.Aladdin returns to the palace and destroys Jafar's magic staff, ending his spell over the Sultanand exposing his plot, and Jafar is imprisoned. The Sultan allows Aladdin to marry Jasmine;Aladdin decides to save his final wish, aware that he will lose Jasmine if the truth unfolds, muchto the Genie's disappointment.Freed by his scarlet macaw sidekick, Iago, Jafar steals the lamp and becomes the Genie'snew master. He uses his first wish to become sultan, but Jasmine reminds the palace guards oftheir true loyalty, turning them against Jafar. Using his second wish to become the world's mostpowerful sorcerer, Jafar exposes Aladdin and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland, thenthreatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding,Jasmine swipes the lamp and tries to escape with Aladdin and Abu, who were rescued by themagic carpet. Chased by Iago, whom Jafar briefly transforms into a roc, they are recaptured,destroying the magic carpet in the process.Aladdin taunts Jafar for being second in power to the Genie, goading him into using his lastwish to become "the most powerful being in the universe", and the Genie transforms Jafar intoan even more powerful genie. This traps Jafar inside his own lamp, dragging Iago with him, andthe Genie banishes them to the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin keeps his promise and uses his lastwish to free the Genie, allowing him to live as a human. The Sultan crowns Jasmine the newsultana-regnant, no longer bound to marry a prince, and she and Aladdin marry. The Geniemarries Dalia and they start a family and explore the world together, becoming the Mariner whois telling his children the story about Aladdin in the beginning of the movie.Questions :1.

Aladdin and The Magic Lamp
Once upon a time, there lived a handsome boy in Baghdad. The name was Aladdin. He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.
   One day Aladdin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewelry. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”
   Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave.
Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.”
“Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”
Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”
  The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.
  Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”
  Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.
   Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.
   One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long, Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.

The Legend of Beowulf
Once upon a time, there was a horrible monster called Grendel. He was half-man and half monster. He lived in Denmark. One day, he went to the King's castle. The king and his men tried to kill the monster but their swords were useless. A knight called Beowulf heard about the problem and went to Denmark to help the king.
That night, Beowulf and his men took off their armour and put away their swords and went to sleep. The monster came into the castle and killed a knight. Beowulf woke up and fought the monster-he pulled off an arm! Grendel went back to his home in a lake and died. Grendel's mother was very angry and the next night she went to the castle and killed a knight.
In the morning, Beowulf went to the lake. He killed Grendel's mother with a special sword. When he came back, the king was very happy and he gave Beowulf presents and money.
Beowulf went back to his country and became a king. He was king for fifty years. But one day, a dragon came to his country, and it attacked people. It lived in a cave with treasure.

                                            Once upon a time, there lived a handsome boy in Baghdad. The name was Aladdin. He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.One day Aladin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewellery. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave.Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.”“Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long,  and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.</a>

                            6. Aladdin, a street urchin in the Arabian city of Agrabah, and his monkey Abu meet PrincessJasmine, who has snuck away from her sheltered life in the palace. Jasmine wishes to succeedher father as Sultan, but is instead expected to marry one of her royal suitors, including thecharming yet dimwitted Prince Anders. Jafar, the grand vizier, schemes to overthrow the Sultanand seeks a magic lamp hidden in the Cave of Wonders, but only "the diamond in the rough" canenter the cave.After sneaking into the royal palace and visiting Jasmine, Aladdin is captured by Jafar. Heoffers to make Aladdin rich enough to impress Jasmine in exchange for retrieving the lamp, andwarns him to take nothing else. Inside the cave, Aladdin frees a magic carpet and finds the lamp,but Abu cannot resist touching some treasure and causes the cave to collapse. Aladdin gives thelamp to Jafar, who double crosses and kicks him and Abu into the cave, but Abu steals the lampback.Trapped in the cave, Aladdin rubs the lamp, unwittingly summoning the omnipotent Genieinside, who explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin gets them outof the cave without using a wish on a technicality: he did not rub the lamp in the first place as hestated the wish. Determined to woo Jasmine, he uses his official first wish to become a prince,and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude and turn him human.Aladdin makes an extravagant arrival at Agrabah as Prince Ali of Ababwa, but fails toimpress Jasmine. Posing as Aladdin's human attendant, the Genie is mutually smitten with Dalia,Jasmine's handmaiden. Aladdin and Jasmine bond when he takes her on a ride on the magiccarpet. Tricked into revealing his true identity, he lies to her, saying that he actually is a princeand dressed like a peasant to explore Agrabah.Jafar discovers Aladdin's identity and throws him into the palace moat, knowing that if hesurvives, it will prove he has the lamp. The Genie saves Aladdin, at the cost of his second wish.Aladdin returns to the palace and destroys Jafar's magic staff, ending his spell over the Sultanand exposing his plot, and Jafar is imprisoned. The Sultan allows Aladdin to marry Jasmine;Aladdin decides to save his final wish, aware that he will lose Jasmine if the truth unfolds, muchto the Genie's disappointment.Freed by his scarlet macaw sidekick, Iago, Jafar steals the lamp and becomes the Genie'snew master. He uses his first wish to become sultan, but Jasmine reminds the palace guards oftheir true loyalty, turning them against Jafar. Using his second wish to become the world's mostpowerful sorcerer, Jafar exposes Aladdin and exiles him and Abu to a frozen wasteland, thenthreatens to kill the Sultan and Dalia unless Jasmine agrees to marry him. At the wedding,Jasmine swipes the lamp and tries to escape with Aladdin and Abu, who were rescued by themagic carpet. Chased by Iago, whom Jafar briefly transforms into a roc, they are recaptured,destroying the magic carpet in the process.Aladdin taunts Jafar for being second in power to the Genie, goading him into using his lastwish to become "the most powerful being in the universe", and the Genie transforms Jafar intoan even more powerful genie. This traps Jafar inside his own lamp, dragging Iago with him, andthe Genie banishes them to the Cave of Wonders. Aladdin keeps his promise and uses his lastwish to free the Genie, allowing him to live as a human. The Sultan crowns Jasmine the newsultana-regnant, no longer bound to marry a prince, and she and Aladdin marry. The Geniemarries Dalia and they start a family and explore the world together, becoming the Mariner whois telling his children the story about Aladdin in the beginning of the movie.Questions :1.

Aladdin and The Magic Lamp
Once upon a time, there lived a handsome boy in Baghdad. The name was Aladdin. He was a clever boy, but he did not like to work.
   One day Aladdin’s mother sent him to the market place to look for a job. In the market he met a magician. The magician asked him to work together with him. If Aladdin could do, he would get a lot of gold coins and jewelry. The magician asked Aladdin to go inside the cave and find a magical lamp there. He also gave a ring and said, “If you are in any trouble, rub this ring and a genie will come to your rescue!”
   Aladdin went into the cave. Inside the cave, Aladdin was surprised by what he saw. Every corner was full of gold and treasures. A few minutes later, he found the lamp and quickly returned to the entrance of the cave.
Aladdin called out, “Magician, I have found the lamp.”
“Excellent,” answered the magician. “Quick, pass it to me!”
Aladdin did not trust the magician so he said, “Not so fast Magician. You must help me out of this cave first.”
  The magician became very angry. When Aladdin was walking to the entrance, the magician pushed a huge rock over the entrance of the cave and left Aladdin and the lamp behind. Aladdin tried to move the rock all by himself, but it was too big and heavy, “Oh no! I am trapped in the cave!” he cried.
  Suddenly, he remembered the magic ring. He rubbed it with the palm of his hand. To his surprise, a genie appeared before him and in a powerful voice said, “Master, I am the Genie of the ring. How can I help you?”
  Aladdin was frightened, but he soon found the courage to ask, “Could you please send me back to my house?” In no time at all Aladdin was back home.
   Aladdin took out the lamp. He wondered what would happen if he rubbed it. As Aladdin was rubbing it, all of a sudden another enormous genie stood before him. The genie of the lamp said, “Master, your wish is my command.” Aladdin was very excited and wished for an enormous palace and bags full of gold.
   One day, a beautiful princess was passing by Aladdin’s palace. She stopped to talk to Aladdin and soon they became good friends. Before long, Aladdin and Jasmine fell in love each other. She married Aladdin and lived happily.

The Legend of Beowulf
Once upon a time, there was a horrible monster called Grendel. He was half-man and half monster. He lived in Denmark. One day, he went to the King's castle. The king and his men tried to kill the monster but their swords were useless. A knight called Beowulf heard about the problem and went to Denmark to help the king.
That night, Beowulf and his men took off their armour and put away their swords and went to sleep. The monster came into the castle and killed a knight. Beowulf woke up and fought the monster-he pulled off an arm! Grendel went back to his home in a lake and died. Grendel's mother was very angry and the next night she went to the castle and killed a knight.
In the morning, Beowulf went to the lake. He killed Grendel's mother with a special sword. When he came back, the king was very happy and he gave Beowulf presents and money.
