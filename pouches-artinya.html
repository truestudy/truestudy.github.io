                Timun ms
This tale brings us to the mystical island of java,indonesia.where a widow named mbok sirni lived alone on her farm.
     The widow was a kindly woman ,yet she was overwhelmed by loneliness and longed to have a child by her side,when her linoless became too much to bear , mbok sirni decided  to pray to Buto Ijo for help.
     Buto Ijo was a monstrous ogre who lived on the outskirts of the village,and was known to occasionally grant wishes to people.
     The monster of offered to grant the mbok sirni's wish at a terrible price,"when the child turns six years old,you will return her to me to become my meal".he said.
     Despite to condition ,the desperate woman agreed to his demand.The giant then gave her a single cucumber seed to be planted at her farm.
     In two weeks the cucumber started to bear fruit , yet among theme there was one which was larger than the rest that emitted a golden radiance.
     Splitting it carefully,Mbok sirni found a beautiful baby girl inside .  Filled with joy,she named the girl Timun Mas.
     Alas,she had come to love her daughter over the years,and couldn't bear to lose   Timun Mas,and yet she would never be able to stand up to the powerful ogre.
     Desperate for help ,she journeyed to Gunung Kidul.The southern mountain,to seek advice from a powerful hermit.
     After heaving her plight,the hermit presented Mbok Sirni with four small pouches"Give there to Timun Mas", the hermit told her "they will help your daughter against the monster".
     The day finnaly arrived where the ogre came to the Mbok Sirni's house,eager for her to fulfil her promise."where is my meal?".for hours,the monster chased after Timun Mas and Botu Ijo was steadily getting closer.
     Remembering her mother's advice,she threw the first of the pouches,a bag cucumbers maginally sprang forth from the earth blocking Buto Ijo's path.The ogre entice by the fruit stopped in his eracks to gorge on them.It wasn't long before he ate them all and resumed his chase,just as the monster was about to catch up to Timun Mas,she threw the second gift  a small bag of needles at him.
     A dense forest of sharp bamboo trees appeared where the needles had fallen  trapping Buto ijo.
     The giant ogre eventually burst through the bamboo threes wounded and enraged.
     Once more as he neared Timun Mas,she tossed the third pouch full of salt at he monster hoping to slow him down.Suddenly , out burst a powerful torrent of sea water forming a giant wave which swept the ogre off his feet.
     Buto Ijo is now determined more than ever to catch this little girl who had trouble him so.
     Timun mas had no where left to trun and in her hand she held the last of the hermit's gift.She hurled the small bag hard as she coulds at the monster.
     The bag containing spice had transformed into a boiling sea of mud burning Buto Ijo's skin. The monster struggled in the mud,he shreieked and howled in pain. And then all was silent.
     Timun mas had finnaly stopped Buto Ijo once and for all.Returning to her house,her delighted mother embraced her in arms and they both lived out the rest of their days in peace.  </a>

Madrills are extremely colorful, perhaps more so than any other mammals. They are easily identifiable by the blue and red on their faces and their brightly hued rumps. These distinctive colors become brighter when the animal is extuced. They also have extremely long canine teeth that can be used for self-defense-though baring them is typically a friendly gesture among madrills.	These are primarily terrestrial monkeys and they move with long arm to forage on the ground for fruits, roots and animals such as insects, reptiles and amphibians. Their cheeks have built-in pouches that are used to store snacks for later consumption. Though mandrills spend much of their time on the ground they can climb trees and do so to sleep.	Mandrills live in troops, which are headed by a dominant male and include a dozen or more females and young. They also gather in multi-male/multi-female groups that can include some 200 individuals.	These colorful primates are threatened. They are often hunted as bushmeat and many africants cosider them to be a delicacy. Mandrills are feeling the squeeze of spreading agriculcure and human settlement-both are shrinking their rain forest homeland1.Where do mandrills usually sleep?a.on the treeb.under the treec.on the groundd.under their nests2.How do mandrills defend themselves?a.By shouting loudlyb.By biting the enemyc.By spiting food in their cheeksd.By showing bright rumps3.What is the topic of the third paragraph?a.Mandrill’s habitatb.Mandrill’s predatorc.Mandrill’s dietaryd.Mandrill’s behavior4.What can we infer for the text?a.Mandrills are individual living mammalsb.Adult mandrills have ony blue face colorc.Mandrills live almost all of the rain forest in the worldd.Mandrills are decreasing in numbers because of being hunted​</a>

                                            The Story of Timun Mas
This tale brings us to the mystical island of Java Indonesia. There was a widow
named Mbok Srini that lived alone on her farm. The widow was a kindly woman and she
was overwhelmed by loneliness and longed to have a child by her side. When her
loneliness became too much to bear, Mbok Srini decided to pray to Butho Ijo for help.
Butho Ijo was a mounstrous ogre who lived on the outskirts of the village and was known
to occasionally grant wishes to people.
The monster offered to grant Mbok Srini's wish at a terrible price. "When the child
turns six years old, you will return her to me to become my meal", he said. Despite the
condition, the desperate woman agreed to his demand. The giant then gave a single
cucumber seed to be planted at her farm.
In two weeks, the cucumber started to bear fruit. In among them, there was one which
was which was larger than the rest that emitted a golden radiance. Splitting it carefully,
Mbok Srini found a beautiful baby girl in side. Filled with joy, she named the girl Timun
Emas.
Alas, she had come to love her daughter over the years, and couldn't bear to lose
Timun Emas, and yet, she would never be able to stand up to the powerful ogre.
Desperate for help, she journeyed to Gunom Kidu the southern mountain to seek advice
from a powerful hermit. After hearing her plight, the hermit presented Mbok Srini, the
four small pouches. "Give these to Timun Emas" the hermit told her. They will help your
daughter against the monster.
The day finally arrived when the ogre came to Mbok Srini's house eager for her to
fulfill her promise. "Where is my meal?!" “Hey”. For hours the monster chased after Timun
Emas and Butho Ijo steady getting closer. Remembering her mother's advice, she threw
the first of the pouches bag of cucumber seeds at the monster. Vines of cucumber
magically sprang from the earth blocking Butho Ijo's path. The ogre enticed by the fruit,
stopped on its tracks to gorge on them. It wasn't long before he ate them all and resume
his chase. Just as the monster was about to catch up Timun Emas, she threw the second
gift, the small bag of needles at him. The dense forest of shack bamboo trees appeared
where the needles had fallen trapping Butho Ijo. The giant ogre went through first to the
bamboo trees wounded and enridged. Once more, as he near to Timun Emas, she tossed
the third pouch full of salt at the monster, hoping to slow him down.
Suddenly, an embracing and powerful torn to seek forming a giant wave which
swept the ogre off his feet. Butho Ijo wanted more than ever to catch this little girl. who
troubled him. Timun Emas had nowhere left to run and in her hand, she held the last of
the hermit's gifts. She hurled the small bag as hard as she could at the monster. The bag
containing spice transformed into a boiling sea of mud burning Butho Ijo's skin. The
monster struggled in the mud, he shrieked and howled in pain. and then, all was silent...
Timun Emas had finally stopped Butho Ijo, once, and for all. Returning to her house, her
delighted mother embraced her in her arms. And they both lived out their rest of their
days.

Lavender is a type of plant found on almost all continents. It has a purplish colour. It has a colour named after it, called lavendar. Its Latin and scientific name is Lavandula.
Lavenders are very popular among gardeners. Sometimes their petals are dried and sealed in pouches for good scent, and sometimes put inside clothes to prevent moths, who can damage the clothes.
Lavenders are also used in cake decorating, because the flowers can become candied. Sometimes they are used in flavoring baked goods and chocolate desserts, and sometimes they use it to make a very delicious "lavender
sugar". Lavender flowers are also used to make tea. The French make lavender syrup, which is used to make lavender scones and lavender marshmallows.
Lavenders are sometimes put in medicine, too, and sometimes to prevent infection - such as lavender oil, that was used in World War 1 to disinfect walls and floors of the hospital. As the folk wisdom says, lavender oil is also helpful to headaches when rubbed on your temple, and lavender tea helps you relax before bed time. Lavender also is very helpful when applied to insect bites.
Sometimes, dried petals of lavender are used to throw confetti at a wedding.

I just got a new bag from my aunt. I received it as a birthday gift from her. She bought it in Bali iast
week when she was attending job training
The bag is very nice. I like something mostly because of its simplicity. The same reason makes me
love this bag. It is not only simply because we can put the bag on my back, but also because it has a
wide space in it. Therefore, I can almost bring anything I need with only one bag
The bag's color is blue. It is also my favorite color. It is made of thick cotton. The bag is divided into
hree pouches, the big pouch, the average pouch, and the small pouch. Each of them has its own zipper.
The small pouch is a little bit different from the other because it is covered by rubber. The small pouch
where I usually keep my flash drive, key, and pen.</a>

This tale brings us to the mystical island of java,indonesia.where a widow named mbok sirni lived alone on her farm.
     The widow was a kindly woman ,yet she was overwhelmed by loneliness and longed to have a child by her side,when her linoless became too much to bear , mbok sirni decided  to pray to Buto Ijo for help.
     Buto Ijo was a monstrous ogre who lived on the outskirts of the village,and was known to occasionally grant wishes to people.
     The monster of offered to grant the mbok sirni's wish at a terrible price,"when the child turns six years old,you will return her to me to become my meal".he said.
     Despite to condition ,the desperate woman agreed to his demand.The giant then gave her a single cucumber seed to be planted at her farm.
     In two weeks the cucumber started to bear fruit , yet among theme there was one which was larger than the rest that emitted a golden radiance.
     Splitting it carefully,Mbok sirni found a beautiful baby girl inside .  Filled with joy,she named the girl Timun Mas.
     Alas,she had come to love her daughter over the years,and couldn't bear to lose   Timun Mas,and yet she would never be able to stand up to the powerful ogre.
     Desperate for help ,she journeyed to Gunung Kidul.The southern mountain,to seek advice from a powerful hermit.
     After heaving her plight,the hermit presented Mbok Sirni with four small pouches"Give there to Timun Mas", the hermit told her "they will help your daughter against the monster".
     The day finnaly arrived where the ogre came to the Mbok Sirni's house,eager for her to fulfil her promise."where is my meal?".for hours,the monster chased after Timun Mas and Botu Ijo was steadily getting closer.
     Remembering her mother's advice,she threw the first of the pouches,a bag cucumbers maginally sprang forth from the earth blocking Buto Ijo's path.The ogre entice by the fruit stopped in his eracks to gorge on them.It wasn't long before he ate them all and resumed his chase,just as the monster was about to catch up to Timun Mas,she threw the second gift  a small bag of needles at him.
     A dense forest of sharp bamboo trees appeared where the needles had fallen  trapping Buto ijo.
     The giant ogre eventually burst through the bamboo threes wounded and enraged.
     Once more as he neared Timun Mas,she tossed the third pouch full of salt at he monster hoping to slow him down.Suddenly , out burst a powerful torrent of sea water forming a giant wave which swept the ogre off his feet.
     Buto Ijo is now determined more than ever to catch this little girl who had trouble him so.
     Timun mas had no where left to trun and in her hand she held the last of the hermit's gift.She hurled the small bag hard as she coulds at the monster.
     The bag containing spice had transformed into a boiling sea of mud burning Buto Ijo's skin. The monster struggled in the mud,he shreieked and howled in pain. And then all was silent.
     Timun mas had finnaly stopped Buto Ijo once and for all.Returning to her house,her delighted mother embraced her in arms and they both lived out the rest of their days in peace.  </h2><br />

                            9. 	Madrills are the large of all monkeys. They are shy and reclusive primates that live only in the rain forest of equitorial Afrika.	Madrills are extremely colorful, perhaps more so than any other mammals. They are easily identifiable by the blue and red on their faces and their brightly hued rumps. These distinctive colors become brighter when the animal is extuced. They also have extremely long canine teeth that can be used for self-defense-though baring them is typically a friendly gesture among madrills.	These are primarily terrestrial monkeys and they move with long arm to forage on the ground for fruits, roots and animals such as insects, reptiles and amphibians. Their cheeks have built-in pouches that are used to store snacks for later consumption. Though mandrills spend much of their time on the ground they can climb trees and do so to sleep.

                            13. The Story of Timun Mas
This tale brings us to the mystical island of Java Indonesia. There was a widow
named Mbok Srini that lived alone on her farm. The widow was a kindly woman and she
was overwhelmed by loneliness and longed to have a child by her side. When her
loneliness became too much to bear, Mbok Srini decided to pray to Butho Ijo for help.
Butho Ijo was a mounstrous ogre who lived on the outskirts of the village and was known
to occasionally grant wishes to people.
The monster offered to grant Mbok Srini's wish at a terrible price. "When the child
turns six years old, you will return her to me to become my meal", he said. Despite the
condition, the desperate woman agreed to his demand. The giant then gave a single
cucumber seed to be planted at her farm.
In two weeks, the cucumber started to bear fruit. In among them, there was one which
was which was larger than the rest that emitted a golden radiance. Splitting it carefully,
Mbok Srini found a beautiful baby girl in side. Filled with joy, she named the girl Timun
Emas.
Alas, she had come to love her daughter over the years, and couldn't bear to lose
Timun Emas, and yet, she would never be able to stand up to the powerful ogre.
Desperate for help, she journeyed to Gunom Kidu the southern mountain to seek advice
from a powerful hermit. After hearing her plight, the hermit presented Mbok Srini, the
four small pouches. "Give these to Timun Emas" the hermit told her. They will help your
daughter against the monster.
The day finally arrived when the ogre came to Mbok Srini's house eager for her to
fulfill her promise. "Where is my meal?!" “Hey”. For hours the monster chased after Timun
Emas and Butho Ijo steady getting closer. Remembering her mother's advice, she threw
the first of the pouches bag of cucumber seeds at the monster. Vines of cucumber
magically sprang from the earth blocking Butho Ijo's path. The ogre enticed by the fruit,
stopped on its tracks to gorge on them. It wasn't long before he ate them all and resume
his chase. Just as the monster was about to catch up Timun Emas, she threw the second
gift, the small bag of needles at him. The dense forest of shack bamboo trees appeared
where the needles had fallen trapping Butho Ijo. The giant ogre went through first to the
bamboo trees wounded and enridged. Once more, as he near to Timun Emas, she tossed
the third pouch full of salt at the monster, hoping to slow him down.
Suddenly, an embracing and powerful torn to seek forming a giant wave which
swept the ogre off his feet. Butho Ijo wanted more than ever to catch this little girl. who
troubled him. Timun Emas had nowhere left to run and in her hand, she held the last of
the hermit's gifts. She hurled the small bag as hard as she could at the monster. The bag
containing spice transformed into a boiling sea of mud burning Butho Ijo's skin. The
monster struggled in the mud, he shrieked and howled in pain. and then, all was silent...
Timun Emas had finally stopped Butho Ijo, once, and for all. Returning to her house, her
delighted mother embraced her in her arms. And they both lived out their rest of their
days.

Lavender is a type of plant found on almost all continents. It has a purplish colour. It has a colour named after it, called lavendar. Its Latin and scientific name is Lavandula.
Lavenders are very popular among gardeners. Sometimes their petals are dried and sealed in pouches for good scent, and sometimes put inside clothes to prevent moths, who can damage the clothes.
Lavenders are also used in cake decorating, because the flowers can become candied. Sometimes they are used in flavoring baked goods and chocolate desserts, and sometimes they use it to make a very delicious "lavender
sugar". Lavender flowers are also used to make tea. The French make lavender syrup, which is used to make lavender scones and lavender marshmallows.
Lavenders are sometimes put in medicine, too, and sometimes to prevent infection - such as lavender oil, that was used in World War 1 to disinfect walls and floors of the hospital. As the folk wisdom says, lavender oil is also helpful to headaches when rubbed on your temple, and lavender tea helps you relax before bed time. Lavender also is very helpful when applied to insect bites.
Sometimes, dried petals of lavender are used to throw confetti at a wedding.

                            22. Asad the text and answer the following questions!
I just got a new bag from my aunt. I received it as a birthday gift from her. She bought it in Bali iast
week when she was attending job training
The bag is very nice. I like something mostly because of its simplicity. The same reason makes me
love this bag. It is not only simply because we can put the bag on my back, but also because it has a
wide space in it. Therefore, I can almost bring anything I need with only one bag
The bag's color is blue. It is also my favorite color. It is made of thick cotton. The bag is divided into
hree pouches, the big pouch, the average pouch, and the small pouch. Each of them has its own zipper.
The small pouch is a little bit different from the other because it is covered by rubber. The small pouch
where I usually keep my flash drive, key, and pen.</h2><br />
