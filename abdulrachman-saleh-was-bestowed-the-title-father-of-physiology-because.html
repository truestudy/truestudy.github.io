Galileo developeda superior telescope and made many significant discoveries in astronomy. He wassentenced to life imprisonment by the inquisition for his support for theCopernican theory that the sun was at the centre of the solar system.Galileo was born in Florence, Italy in 1564 to a poor but noble family. His parents recognized theirchild’s innate intelligence and talents and so made sacrifices to have himeducated. At his father’s insistence, Galileo studied the profitable career ofmedicine. But, at the University of Pisa, Galileo became fascinated in a widerange of subjects. He was also critical of many of Aristotle’s teaching whichhad dominated education for the past 2,000 years.Galileo was appointed to be a mathematics professor at the University ofPisa, but his strident criticisms of Aristotle left him isolated among hiscontemporaries. After three years of persecution, he resigned and went to theUniversity of Padua, where he taught math. His entertaining lectures attracteda large following and he was able to spend the next 18 years pursuing hisinterests in astronomy and mechanics.Source:http://englishadmin.com/2018/12/50-contoh-soal-recount-text-biography-dan-jawaban.htmlAfter reading the text, answer these questions:1.

Galileo developeda superior telescope and made many significant discoveries in astronomy. He wassentenced to life imprisonment by the inquisition for his support for theCopernican theory that the sun was at the centre of the solar system.Galileo was born in Florence, Italy in 1564 to a poor but noble family. His parents recognized theirchild’s innate intelligence and talents and so made sacrifices to have himeducated. At his father’s insistence, Galileo studied the profitable career ofmedicine. But, at the University of Pisa, Galileo became fascinated in a widerange of subjects. He was also critical of many of Aristotle’s teaching whichhad dominated education for the past 2,000 years.Galileo was appointed to be a mathematics professor at the University ofPisa, but his strident criticisms of Aristotle left him isolated among hiscontemporaries. After three years of persecution, he resigned and went to theUniversity of Padua, where he taught math. His entertaining lectures attracteda large following and he was able to spend the next 18 years pursuing hisinterests in astronomy and mechanics.Source:http://englishadmin.com/2018/12/50-contoh-soal-recount-text-biography-dan-jawaban.htmlAfter reading the text, answer these questions:1.
