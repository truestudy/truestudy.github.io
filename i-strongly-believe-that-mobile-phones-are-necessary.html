                                            strongly believe that mobile phones are necessary. My reasons for this belief are that these phones are convenient for business people who travel a lot, and they are handy for emergencies. To begin with, mobile phones are necessary in the case of emergencies. For instance, if you fall down a set of stairs in a building and are badly injured and can’t reach a pay phone, it is handy to have one to use. Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighbourhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth. My other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can’t stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile. In conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of every day life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium.Practice 1: First, read the reading text above to understand the previous analyctical eksposition.

                                            Text for Questions number 7-8Mobile phoneCurrently, the number of students who bring mobile phones to school is increasing. They are allowedto do this by their parents for emergency reasons. From my points of view, bringing mobile phones to schoolcan be accepted, as long as it does not disturb learning activities in the classroom.Students commonly go to school and come home without their parents. In this case, I believe thatmobile phones are essential. If the students get into some trouble on their way, they can phone their parentsimmediately.Moreover, the parents need to inform their children every time they have to get home late from work.I have no doubt that mobile phones are very useful for parents. Parents can easily contact relatives to take careof their children when they have to be late.Nevertheless, what makes mobile phones annoying is the fact that the ringing of the mobile phonessan interrupt the learning process in the classroom. The students will also lose concentration when they theirfriends.In conclusion, my attitude towards this case is that students can bring their mobile phones to school foremergency cases, as long as they turn them off in the class.7.

My reasons for this belief are that these phones are convenient for business people who travel a lot, and they are handy for emergencies.To begin with, mobile phones are necessary in the case of emergencies. For instance, if you fall down a set of stairs in a building and are badly injured and can’t reach a pay phone, it is handy to have one to use. Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighborhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth.My other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can’t stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile.In conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of every day life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium.2.

My reasons for this belief are that these phones are convenient for business people who travel a lot, and they are handy for emergencies.To begin with, mobile phones are necessary in the case of emergencies. For instance, if you fall down a set of stairs in a building and are badly injured and can’t reach a pay phone, it is handy to have one to use. Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighborhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth.My other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can’t stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile.In conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of every day life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium.2.

They are allowedto do this by their parents for emergency reasons. From my points of view, bringing mobile phones to schoolcan be accepted, as long as it does not disturb learning activities in the classroom.Students commonly go to school and come home without their parents. In this case, I believe thatmobile phones are essential. If the students get into some trouble on their way, they can phone their parentsimmediately.Moreover, the parents need to inform their children every time they have to get home late from work.I have no doubt that mobile phones are very useful for parents. Parents can easily contact relatives to take careof their children when they have to be late.Nevertheless, what makes mobile phones annoying is the fact that the ringing of the mobile phonessan interrupt the learning process in the classroom. The students will also lose concentration when they theirfriends.In conclusion, my attitude towards this case is that students can bring their mobile phones to school foremergency cases, as long as they turn them off in the class.7.

My reasons for this belief are that these phones are convenient for business people who travel a lot, and they are handy for emergencies.To begin with, mobile phones are necessary in the case of emergencies. For instance, if you fall down a set of stairs in a building and are badly injured and can’t reach a pay phone, it is handy to have one to use. Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighborhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth.My other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can’t stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile.In conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of every day life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium.2.

                            28. I strongly believe that mobile phones are necessary. My reasons for this belief are that these phones are convenient for business people who travel a lot, and they are handy for emergencies.To begin with, mobile phones are necessary in the case of emergencies. For instance, if you fall down a set of stairs in a building and are badly injured and can’t reach a pay phone, it is handy to have one to use. Or, if your car breaks down in the middle of the night in a strange neighbourhood, it would be dangerous to leave it in search of a public phone booth.My other main reason is that mobile phones are convenient for business people. For example, if you are out of the state or even overseas and you have to contact a client to do some important work, it is useful to have one to use. By using a mobile phone, important information can be received. People can’t stay in an office all day waiting for their phone to ring. Some people have to go and do jobs or they will go out of business. You can even send faxes or messages and use the internet with your mobile.In conclusion, I believe that mobile phones have now become a necessary part of every day life. Instant communication will ensure that information can be passed on with a simple press of a button. Whether this is to do with business or personal information or emergencies, it goes to show that they are necessary in the new millennium.Perhatikan, hampir seluruh kalimat dalam teks berbentuk simple present tense yang dicirikan dengan penggunaan kata kerja atau verb 1.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>artinya : benar-benar percaya bahwa ponsel itu perlu. Alasan saya untuk keyakinan ini adalah bahwa ponsel ini nyaman untuk pebisnis yang sering bepergian, dan mereka berguna untuk keadaan darurat. Untuk memulainya, ponsel diperlukan dalam keadaan darurat. Misalnya, jika Anda jatuh dari tangga di sebuah gedung dan terluka parah dan tidak dapat menghubungi telepon umum, akan sangat berguna untuk menggunakannya. Atau, jika mobil Anda mogok di tengah malam di lingkungan yang aneh, akan berbahaya meninggalkannya untuk mencari bilik telepon umum. Alasan utama saya yang lain adalah ponsel mudah digunakan untuk pebisnis. Misalnya, jika Anda berada di luar negara atau bahkan di luar negeri dan Anda harus menghubungi klien untuk melakukan beberapa pekerjaan penting, ada baiknya menggunakannya untuk digunakan. Dengan menggunakan ponsel, informasi penting dapat diterima. Orang tidak bisa tinggal di kantor sepanjang hari menunggu telepon mereka berdering. Beberapa orang harus pergi dan melakukan pekerjaan atau mereka akan keluar dari bisnis. Anda bahkan dapat mengirim faks atau pesan dan menggunakan internet dengan ponsel Anda. Sebagai kesimpulan, saya percaya bahwa ponsel sekarang telah menjadi bagian penting dari kehidupan sehari-hari. Komunikasi instan akan memastikan bahwa informasi dapat diteruskan dengan menekan satu tombol. Apakah ini berkaitan dengan informasi bisnis atau pribadi atau keadaan darurat, ini menunjukkan bahwa mereka diperlukan di milenium bar</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>#SemangatBelajar</p><p></p><p></p><p>Maaf Kalo Salah Ya!</p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
